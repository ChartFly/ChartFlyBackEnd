auth.py (Placeholder Module)

This file previously handled all authentication logic for ChartFly.
As part of the 2025 refactor, logic has been modularized into:

- auth_login_register.py   → Handles login and user registration
- auth_password_reset.py   → Handles forgot/reset password workflows

This placeholder is reserved for future authentication features:
- Session validation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Token refresh endpoints
- Optional 2FA (TOTP or SMS/email-based)

Keep this file in the project for future expansions of the authentication system.
